# Game Project Scope Study

## Required Readings

-   [Game Project](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project)
-   [Game API](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/game-project-api)
-   [What is a User Story](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories)

## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.

**Disclaimer: I worked on Sketch to complete these wireframes as a sort of challenge and while I do like the
design I don't know that I'll actually be able to make my app look like this.

Additionally, the app would look nearly identical whether on mobile, tablet, or desktop devices and would simply have different media inquiries to adjust the size of the board and sign up/log in forms.

-   The data structure you plan to use.

I plan to use arrays, lists, and objects for my data structure, and will attempt to use a single array for my game play logic (as recommended by Jason).

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS

I plan on using a table with each tile as a table cell.

-   How you plan to approach this project.

I plan on writing out the fundamental HTML and CSS to construct a game board, and then tackling the game play logic in JS. From there I will construct the sign up/log in forms, log out button, new game button, and stats display, and then work on refining the aesthetics of the app.

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.

As a user, I want to be able to sign up to play.
As a user, I want to be able to start a new game.
As a user, I want to know whose turn it is to play.
As a user, I want to know who won or lost.
As a user, I want to know how many games I've won or lost.
As a user, I want to be able to play someone on another device.
As a user, I want to be able to log in and retrieve my data.

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.

I'll be keeping my code organized inside of short and easy to identify folders (styles, assets, scripts) and files, including but not limited to index.html, index.css, api.js, events.js, ui.js, config.js, and store.js.

-   What creative spin will you add to your project?

I'm honestly trying to make sure I can finish all of the requirements in the time given while making the app look even remotely like my Sketch wireframes. If I can do that and still have some time left I might try and implement some sort of dynamic movement effects to the background or game pieces.

-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?

I want on use a few different branches while I work on the preliminary code so that I can keep track of what works and what doesn't. I'll also be committing as frequently as possible and writing detailed commit messages.

-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?

As of right now it seems unlikely. 

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
